# MaicoV2
 
## Session example:

In this example, we show some parts of a session by Brachtel using MAICO. 
Although we can show some visualizations used and also the synthesized primer and some of the export files, we cannot say the exact influence of the output on the compositions, as we cannot track them after Maico.
All visualizations should be close to the ones Brachtel used, but there is the possibility, that he used a different version and had a few different parameters regarding sizes and colors.

### Sound example: 

We present the monophonic primer and three polyphonic exports from this session in the file "Examples.wav".
The samples are split with a short pause.
All polyphonic samples have three voices. 
We synthesized all samples with a simple piano on each of the voices, so the sound and the feeling could change for different instrumentation. 
We also uploaded the midi files for others to test different combinations.

## Brachtels workflow:

Brachtel started by loading the primer and generated around 1000 monophonic samples with AI, which results in the overview shown in the image "Monophonic.png". 
He then generated the polyphonic combinations and stuck to 3 voices ("Polyphonic.png"). 
Then he explored the dataset using the correlation for number of notes and intervals and the two timbre visualizations ("CorrelationLineglyph", "TImbrePCP", "TimbreRootD").
He mainly stuck to the melodylineglyph and looked for interesting melodies regarding the root note D. 
During this exploration he added some melodies to the export folder and exported them as midi files, including the three examples from above.

As previously mentioned, the concrete impact of these exports on the compositions are unclear, but this example should give a few insights into how Brachtel used Maico and the resulting output.
