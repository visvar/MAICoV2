# MaicoV2
 
## Sound examples:

These sound files are direct results of the work from Benedikt Brachtel, who used MAICO to create a commissioned work called "MOSI" for the "Residenztheater" in Munich.

One of Mosi's main requirements was using a monophonic synthesizer fed with long Midi sequences and live sound generation during the play. 
To this end, Maico provided a strong support, as he could easily generate long sequences of Midi data.

Therefore, he used Maico mainly to generate multiple variations for a single primer melody and exported it as a longer sequence, lining up the chosen samples from MAICO into a single track. 
One of these parts from his files is the "Maico_Output.mid" file, which we synthesized using a simple piano in the corresponding ".wav" file to listen to.

Similar to the workflow in the session example, Brachtel generated around 300 monophonic samples using one of his primer ideas and scimmed the space using the piano roll glyphs. He then marked all interesting samples and exported them in a single file successivly. 
He also mentioned that some of these exports already were some ideas he exported to use in the other commissioned work, and then chose to use them even in the context of Mosi. 

During the play Mosi, he used a monophonic synthesizer, along with samples and fingerdrums, to synthesize the prepared Midi files live. 
One short recording, which matches the "Maico_Output" file is the "Mosi_result.wav" file. 
Unfortunatly, we cannot provide a longer example, because the play involves the voice of the actor and the music is only played in the background. 

## File explanation:

### Maico_Output.mid

The samples, he got from Maico in Midi format. This sample is  the input of the monophonic synthesizer during the play.

### Maico_Output.wav

A self synthesized version of the previous file for easier access. This synthesis has nothing to do with the synthesizer during the play. It is just for users to listen to, as midi files dont have sound themselfes.

### Maico_result.wav

The same section as the "Maico_Output.mid" but as live recording from the play. 
Now the samples are synthesized live as a result from Brachtel's work.
