# MaicoV2
 
## Sound examples:

These sound files are direct results of the work from Benedikt Brachtel, who used MAICO in order to create a commissioned work called "MOSI" for the "Residenztheater" in Munich.

One of the main requirements for Mosi was the usage of a monophonic synthesizer fed with long Midi sequences and live sound generation during the play. 
Therefore, Maico was ideally to use, as he could generate long sequences of Midi data.

Therefore, he used Maico mainly to generate multiple variations for a single primer melody and export it as a longer sequence, lining up the chosen samples from MAICO into a single track. 
One of these parts from his files is the "Maico_Output.mid" file, which we synthesized using a simple piano in the corresponding ".mp3" file to listen to.

While we sadly could not recover the procedure Brachtel used in Maico, he himself mentioned multiple times, that he loaded a in a primer, generated around 300 samples, which he then scimmed using the piano roll glyph for interesting patterns. He then marked all interesting samples and exported it in a single file successivly. 
He also mentioned that some of these exports already were some ideas he exported to use in the other commissioned work, and then chose to use them even in the context of Mosi. 

During the play Mosi, he used a monophonic synthesizer, along with samples and fingerdrums, to synthesize the prepared Midi files live. 
One short recording, which matches the "Maico_Output" file is the "Mosi_result.mp3" file. 
Unfortunatly, we cannot provide a longer example, because the play involves the voice of the actor and the music is only played in the background. 

## File explanation:

### Maico_Output.mid

The samples, he got from Maico in Midi format. This is fed into the monophonic synthesizer during the play.

### Maico_Output.mp3

A self synthesized form of the previous file, so others can easily listen to it. This synthesis has nothing to do with the synthesizer during the play. It is just for users to listen to, as midi files dont have sound itself.

### Maico_result.mp3

The same section as the "Maico_Output.mid" but as live recording from the play. 
Now the samples are synthesized live as a result from Brachtel's work.
