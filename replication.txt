Steps to Generate the Representative Figure

1. Open the Application

Ensure the application is running by running the installation "run.bat" as an Administrator.
Alternativly after installation, one can go to the folder maico "cd maico" and then run "npm run dev".
Open the application in a web browser: "http://localhost:5173/" (or a different port).


2. Load the Dataset and Visual Presets

Click on "Import/Export" located at the top left of the interface.
Scroll down the menu that appears.
Click on "Open Session" to bring up the file selection window.
Select "replicationFigure.json" and confirm the selection.


3. Explanation of the Figure

This process loads a predefined dataset along with visual settings.
The dataset and settings have been chosen to reproduce Figure 9 from the paper ("rau-fig9.png").
The visualization will appear exactly as described in the paper, given the same input conditions.
Note: If needed, the figure can be fine-tuned manually by adjusting the settings.
