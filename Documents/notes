## Notes

poly very slow even when generating very little or the same often
-> clever selection of samples -> some already wont work so dont check them
-> make comparison faster with array of length instead of notes (but could be still too much)
-> if same samples are marked from beginning we could avoid them already


still same sample can appear from generation (filter them? now that model does not matter rly)
-> would be benefitial to poly as well

hilbert not in dataset
